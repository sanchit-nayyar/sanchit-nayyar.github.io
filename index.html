	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Capstone Project</li>
		Capstone project is an industry / research oriented project in the syllabus for TIET, Patiala. In a team of 4 members, we are working on a Remote Controlled prototype of an autonomous car. This car shall be able to navigate through the routes available in a map stored on the server, avoid obstacles and reach the destination with negligible intervention from the driver.<br>

		<li>Neural Network</li>
		Implementation of a 3 Layer Neural Network done from scratch in Python. Trained and tested on the IRIS dataset. This code was my first attempt at understanding how the Machine Learning algorithms work. A descriptive code with standard based variable naming is available on GitHub.<br>

		<li>Python Script for Sorting</li>
		It happens more often than not that we end up with a cluttered downloads folder, with hundreds of unsorted files and it becomes very difficult to manage them. It also slows down the process of loading in this case. To tackle such issues, this script can be handy. In a more general form, it takes the input of the target folder and the extensions which need to be sorted (typically the ones which have numerous files). It puts all those files in folders matching their extension names.<br>

		<li>Python Script for Naming</li>
		Sometimes, the files in a particular directory are named in weird fashions. These cases include the times when we import photos from our smartphone, or put multiple downloaded files in the destination directory without following a naming convention. Managing these files can become a headache, and this script aims to resolve all such issues. It is capable of naming all files with a particular extension in the said directory in the form of &lt;prefix&gt;_&lt;i&gt;.&lt;ext&gt; which enables easy handling of files. The value of <i>i</i> in this convention varies from 1 to whatever the need is, and the other variable terms are input by the user.<br>

		<li>Python Script YouTube Downloader</li>
		All the YouTube Downloaders available on the Internet as on date are able to fetch the video in the required quality and all other requirements, but the only issue is that they need the video URL. This YouTube Downloader is capable of carrying out a search on YouTube and downloading the first video that comes as a response to the said search query. Hence, saving time which is one of the major purposes of automation.<br>
		Future prospects for this script include being able to fetch the video name and asking the user if this is the right video before executing the download process.
